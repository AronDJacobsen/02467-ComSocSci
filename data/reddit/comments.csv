For some reason everyone sells and it drops to $10 the outlook of GME long term is good. Just hold on long till it recovers or gets to a point you are willing to sell. But even if you buy at 60 and it jumps to only $80 that’s still a great return. 

But this stock is going to sky rocket most likely due to the situation at hand. 

Never gamble money you aren’t willing to lose. That should make you feel better. You you are only willing to gamble $60 then just gamble $60"

This is the result of their mismanagement and hubris. They have access to resources no one else does. This is on them. Not every company has these several catalysts converging. It’s just a bit of luck and timing of which they have exploited for so long. Now, on their heels despite outs given they remain bearish and now want to be bailed out by calling us the bad guys. Please


Diamond hands get diamonds."

And cautious when others are greedy. 

NewsFlash people. Wsb is minority, the majority of people are being cautious and sending warnings out. Not a single mainstream popular media is telling people to buy into the squeeze, the most bullish sentiment might be trim and hold. 

Being on WSB makes you a retard and a contrarian. 

Here are things that general media is overly bullish on and I’m fairly cautious on. 

“Cramer been pushing hard on housing and construction” 

“Recovery stocks like airlines etc” 

People are overly cautious about China: BABA don’t give a shit. The fact that it’s duo listed makes it far safer as you could journal over to HK exchange and ride it there. Unless USA delists HK or prevents US funds from investing in HK. (At which point politically it’ll look like US is selling out HK to China. This is a big no no too) 

But let’s be real. USA has literally been at war with Middle East since late 90s, and what was the sentiment with Oil? Peak prices during Middle East conflicts."

Not sure if in american culture this exists but visiting hispanic parties growing up there was a ""tres leche"" (three milk) cake that looked like a regular cake. So let's disect gamestop.

The top of this is the possible short squeeze. The looming probability of a MOASS that will send this to alpha centauri

Ryan Cohen (which is fueling the possible short squeeze but should be kept as a seperate entity) is a valuable component to this, the guy (forgot his name) who is famous for the big short is also LONG on Gamestop, two really nice names there

The bottom layer (these aren't in order) is the most avoided it seems like, but Reggie Fils-Aimé is on the board of directors in an effort to turn the company around. He helped Nintendo a lot when he was president.... 

But the fair value of what these guys can do - i would say speculation alone adds value, what happens under their work should alone bring gamestop to a possible $100+ range... but again, best to do your own DD incase i misread or am false on something"

Are you using screeners to screen for penny stocks and if there's good news on a penny stock you're buying?  Do you have a screener set up you can share?  What do you see on the screener that can tell you what's on the move and why?  I've been trying to find a good set up and having been looking at short float and relative trading volume.

I’d say around 30% is when it will slow down. You can also look for “Short total” or something like that, it was around 71million last I saw. That’s the total amount of shorts, when then starts dropping to around 8 million I would look at selling. “Shorts available to short” is a number showing how many shorts are left to take, when that number starts declining it means they are running out of ammo to drop the price with, that number going down = good thing."

I suspect the article is blatantly lying to drive down the price so institutions can load up. I have seen articles like this several times. They got NKLA lockup expiry wrong (it was off by a whole month) and another institution INCREASED their price target projection on NKLA towards the end of lock up. Why? Because their shares were also locked up and they needed to prop up the stock price so they can get out.

With EVERYONE buying said contracts, they had to keep buying, and the perpetual motion machine took place.

The theoretical limit SHOULD have been 60 because that was the highest strike available to us on GME. Essentially, that's where it stopped. When it went beyond 60 that was more than likely margin calls happening. Margin calls are different per broker and will trigger at multiple times across the squeeze period. There was one last week to get us to the mid 30s after $20 and this is the next one here. If the big guys shorting get margin called, it could go further.

The thing we DON'T know is AT WHAT price everyone is shorted. If we knew that as well as the average margin call numbers, we'd know exactly when a squeeze is about to happen.

Gamma squeezes can definitely trigger this, and while we as a collective may not have the ABILITY to own 20% of gme, we can synthetically raise it by simply dumping our entire paycheck into calls."

Shorted share = when A borrows a share from B with the promise to return it at a later date.  A sells the share on the market for cash, with the hope of buying it cheap later and returning the share to B.

A also pays interest like any other loan to B in the mean time.  They are hoping the stock goes down in order to profit.

Short interest is number of shares borrowed out (shorted) / total number of shares issued by a company


It would be like if there was only 10 apples but 14 people owed apples to someone. Whoever has apples should just demand a crazy price because one way or another, people gotta return the apples they borrowed.  The higher the short interest the harder it is to get your hands on apples being traded for the most reasonable price.  Even if someone does sell an apple for lower than they could, the person who now has it is now likely to try and get as much out of selling it as possible. Especially if they owe more apples to others."

A reasonable guess is that they have locked onto the same opportunity and going for it; makes a lot of sense for them.

While we see that GME could become the #1 ecommerce store for gaming related products - not just games, also merchandise, virtual items, everything in this ecosystem, just like Cohen did it before with Chewy. That GME retail stores could turn into esports cafes / social hubs for gamers. The Starbucks for gamers. That people will not go to GameStop to buy a game, they will buy something because they want to go to GameStop.

And he even gave the best reason for why this is a strong thesis: He says people are buying the stock because of nostalgia for GameStop, because we have fond memories from going there as kids and we just want it to win. Think what this says about their market! Millions of people put their life savings on the line because they want GameStop to win! Unless they really royally fuck this up, how can they fail with such a strong position?"

The Green shows what BUY orders exist. (i.e. someone wants to buy 1k shares at 42.66, 30 shares at 42.58 etc ...) 

The Red shows what SELL orders exist. (i.e. someone wants to sell 300 shares at 42.87, or 406 at 42.96). 

The area under the curve is a surrogate for volume. More area = more demand. You can see there is a lot more green than red, suggesting prices will be driven higher due to significant demand.

The red is a rather flat curve, especially after $50. Once price gets there, roughly, there are not many shares available beyond that to purchase (at this time), so prices will go up quickly as buyers take those shares away. 

Maybe thats more like ELI15.

ELI5 ... the more there is green than red, the more the price will likely go up."

for example, having a good product(s), having good costumers.

A) A Canadian company (not under the same competing issues as USA vs China)

B) Getting a good foothold in the Chinese EV market as they selling a patent and collecting royalties, which is a big source of their revenue (see their recent settlement with Facebook on a patent dispute)

Honestly I feel a lot of their movement is because of the tremendous attention being brought to the EV market (see also $F and $GME and their EV partners). I’ll ride that wave. 🏄‍♂️ 🏄 🏄‍♀️ 🏄‍♂️"
2398,gk3q75z,t3_l1nlw8,1,1611262926,IFromDaFuture,t1_gk3moy7,"Sally sells 500 Seashells because that's all the work she can do in one day. Gathering the seashells, cleaning them, and then staying at her shop all day prevents her from selling any seashells at the beach in the next town over. Sally finds Sand Dollars but sand dollars don't sell at her beach as well so she doesn't collect them.

Jenny sets up a sand dollar stand in the town over and sells 500 sand dollars but has the same problem that Sally does. She finds a lot of seashells but doesn't sell them because they don't move as quickly at her stand. 

Sally and Jenny set up a deal to exchange the seashells and sand dollars each week on Monday and they split the profits made. 

This is why the PC Build a center is important. MSFT needs this because people who are new to the PC building world don't buy directly from them. They buy from NewEgg or Amazon or (enter competitor here). Gamestop will take on the brunt of bringing MSFT new customers by selling their products. the MSFT store is expensive for games, I rarely purchase from them. Gamestop usually has pretty good deals on games. MSFT gaming has great servers, but their efforts are not put into game sales. Gamestop is the opposite, they lack the delivery platform but have the inventory. Gamestop also sells many more different games than XBOX. The XBOX store doesn't have all of the games that Gamestop has. 

If your concept was correct. Amazon would not allow Third-party sellers on their website. Apple would not allow third-party apps on their app store. 

There is a lot of cost in doing many different things at once. Amazon is not a product sales company, they are a client acquisition company. MSFT is in the same boat. It's why their live streaming service failed."

Sounds either a scam or a newbie who placed a limit order in that only partially filled.  They are mistakenly viewing their order confirmation as a purchase, a transaction of money for item. When the order confirmation is really only an purchase offer, that you vendor seeks to match with a sell offer that meets both offers criteria.  The brokerage is not obligated to guarantee you those shares. Just cancel the remaining order and he’ll get the difference back"

If GME decides to pay some dividends then GME pays just as much as many shares GME issued. The rest is paid by those who are in a short position.

Conclusion:  
GME can send much more money to GME shareholders than it costs to GME. The rest is paid by the short position owners.

Further:  
Exercising an uncovered call before ex-div date would create short-long pairs on the market. So the option writer will be in naked short (which costs a lot as the loan fee is above 30%/year and the margin requirements are also rather high, which could cause liquidation issues) for the uncovered call writer.   
The option holder will be in long but he will own shares that have never been issued by GME. In case of a dividend payment the short owner pays the dividend to the long owner and this is why it costs less to GME than the money that the shareholders receive.

GME can get back its investment to its addicted shareholders by issuing some new shares to the market at or above the actual stock price. It is their decision if they do it before or after Melvin Capital has bankrupted.   
At some point of time in the future share sales should happen to close the short positions otherwise the market-makers, clearing houses, so the market itself will be in trouble.

Full adoption by local government forces the market forward. They have relationships with these legacy companies already. 

The lack of dealerships (read SERVICE CENTERS) in almost every city across America will destroy Tesla market share as EV's from legacy companies will be serviced everywhere with ease. 
   There are some GM Cadillac dealers I read about that refused to upgrade for new vehicle technology and are just letting that segment go. They are the outliers, though. 

The new STLA merger between FCA and Peugot shows promise with the EV future as well with their planned ""Platform"" vehicle lineup. 

Tldr...The Tesla pie prints on the reality of other companies futures. That pie is about to get sliced up and Tesla has no forks in most of America."

It is an ongoing legal battle but some European court decisions have hinted that there shouldn't be a difference between physical and non physical copies and how they are treated. Valve lost in a French court in 2019 on this topic but it was just a lower instance. So we will have to see. As long as it is just individuals and some consumer rights organisation's fighting it will take some time. I'm. Just saying in principle it is supposed to be possible. Therefore it might be in the future. 

And sure, physical business is not dead, but I think we can agree it isn't the future either. It is going to diminish, question is just how fast. The slower the better for gamestop, but I think the reasons why physical games are still a thing are the same that will drive a change in how we treat non physical games.

GME is a value investment, which means buy when it’s undervalued, don’t bank on its growth because there’s so many better growing companies you use every day...... think video game developers, stores near GameStop that could see more revenue like restaurants, does GameStop have contracts with digital payment companies? Who are GameStop’s main suppliers (accounts receivable on the 10k) ..... You are doing the leg work of showing up in person and engaging with the business you’re investing in, that’s awesome. But, what you have to look further for edge. I know you’ll beat the market"

They’ve partnered with Amazon, Sony, and they’ve got their software in over 175M cars on the road with over 32 Car brands and more are coming over to QNX. They’re growth is going to be crazy and right now it’s a good deal. Once people realise what blackberry do the hype will start and the checks will come in for us 🚀🚀🚀"

They will trash any strategy that doesn’t follow the Buffet approach of value investing. Maybe for good reason, who knows. The last few years have brought upon a paradigm shift in the markets with the rise of the retail investor, massive collaboration and instant information. I think they are a little short sided in refusing to acknowledge the evolution in the markets and the change in the average investor that technology, user friendly brokerage apps a third grader could use and zero transaction fees has brought us.

And that is a complex duality because a lot of what we think about institutions is A or B instead of A and B. For some of these institutions just like some momentum traders this a beautiful pump &amp; dump. It's easy money. They go in, they get it, they leave.

That's why it takes months, not days, to measure it out. I mean bots and other ""players"" are also going to be in here so you'll see really weird stuff from time to time that looks and feels like it's genuinely forward facing but turns out in two months to be nothing but a blip.

And I mean you are actually just seeing the same image as a positive rather than negative attribute; no one fought Cohen because honestly no one knows what to do with this thing and it isn't that Cohen is brilliant but that at this point it just doesn't fucking matter. 

I mean back to the coach analogy you've got players volunteering and putting up their own money to keep the team going to lead it to the next championship and the coach has no plays in the book so ... fuck it. 

That scares me. I don't see that as a good thing. That is literally the opposite of a good thing in my business mindset. If anyone can walk into your house and decorate the thing that means you're fucked. Keep in mind I am thinking a few years out so it's not going to be a matter of this play. It'll pass. I am more interested in 6 months down the road where this is."

3754,gjianlh,t3_kyrr1x,1,1610832917,miketotaldestroy,t3_kyrr1x,"Economics extremely simplified;

Shares = finite commodity

Short positions need shares to reduce their losses. They have heavy firepower, but remember this is not their whole world, it is probably a small set of their strategy on average. It seems like the only thing that matters to this community but it is not so for them. The cover cost they are able to provide is a function of their net worth and leverage, and thus, determined by their weight class. Large firms can expose themselves to high risk, smaller ventures cannot.

Short positions lost almost a billion last week. They have also doubled down, interestingly, which indicates that they are able to hold their position at price levels of the low 30s and are certain that the share price will drop. Either through paper-handed moves or institutional moves. I would expect that short positions can hold for a cumulative total of a few billion before dropping out as a demographic. I'm expecting a dip to $30 due to manipulation then a squeeze within 14 days. So another sustained large dip before short squeeze, if you bought above $35 then it'll look grim for a while.

Full disclosure my field is economics and not finance, this is just my thinking!

Can you emphasize answers for OTM?

My mind is on GME and everything that’s been going on but also on the notion that I learned (before all this) that OTM are modeled the WORST/RISKIEST yet the most rapid to accumulate premium. I’m trying to wrap my mind around how the Greeks create value. It’s not a linear fashion, that’s for sure and exponential doesn’t seem to be the way it moves either. Vega and interest rates seem to be the sneaky factors that drain value. Theta is the obvious absorber of value. Gamma’s stacking power I’m still trying to grasp... but my main concern is my first question. Once more:

Can an option you buy OTM, ATM or ITM lose you money even if it is ITM?

I know Cannabis has been boosted recently by Dems taking over, but I am not too familiar.

As long as you put some cash in the market you are more inclined to keep an eye on it and you will be more personally invested in doing research. At least dip a toe in if you are not sure!

Get information from multiple sources and try to sort out the noise.

I do this to try and do short term plays. I take some gains and pull out, the stock takes a dip later, and I rinse and repeat. I accept I miss some gains and I lose some gains if I wait too long to sell, but it's what works for me.

You can play long calls and not have any idea what the peak will be. Look at steel gang. We know steel prices are going to drive the stocks higher, but I don't think many of us really know how high it will go. Hence why you have some people end up ""holding the bag"" and others pussying out way too early.

All in all, you need to find a strategy that works for you. If that means aiming for a set price to sell, then make your money. You can always look into strategies that hedge against risk in different ways, butterflies, condors, debit spreads, etc. Gains is gains."

GME popped a few days after announcement which is usually what it takes the market to price the changes for a stock that is mostly under the radar... the volume before was 2-4M which was a joke.

I then took profits on calls without knowing what the fuck im doing and second call had high volatility but dumbass just clicked buy anyways. 


I'm diamond hands with GME now I promise. should I just look for profits and dip because of that high volatility? What would you retards do? Does the $43 break even price mean if I hold until that date anything over $43 is profit x 400?  Also ty for doubling my $3400 to $7000 today. Love you all."

Without that lesson I would have done it again. You should be saying that with pride! Most people’s skepticism prevented them from buying in at all. Also, think about the people who lost money on GME yesterday. 

I sat on the sidelines with skepticism as I watched other people make $ on meme stocks pretty consistently so this time I put $5k on GME and it has paid off handsomely so far - 0 due diligence, as is standard around here."

So listen up fellow autists.

In a follow up to my previous post when we just started taking off, I want to give you paper-handed-scared-to-lose-your baby-gains assed retards a lesson in 💎🤲.

First picture is near the top of todays run.
Second picture current status.
Third is positions.

Times I thought about selling today?
Absolutely fucking ZERO.

I realize half(all) of you cant read, but this is called doing your own research, along with reading your fellow WSBers autist-powered DDs. Once forming a thesis, all it takes to be a man of integrity is betting and believing in yourself to the end. Take a page out of Ryan Cohens book if you’re unwilling to listen to me.

There are numerous factors as to why this is the moment we’ve all been waiting for, and why its just the beginning. 
If you want, lock in them baby gains, but don’t come crying in here with FOMO because you cant spend two minutes looking up the actual fundamental reason behind this entire play, instead of spamming PT? in the comments and listening to the first 🌈🐻.

In short, this moment presents you with a choice to either have some resilience and self belief, or join the rest of the herd while us 💎🤲 and RV teaches you how its done.

TL;DR: 
IM NOT FUCKING SELLING"

 ""This signal time advance could potentially offset or significantly reduce signal detection delays associated with a variety of physical sensors to improve performance in control, intervention, and/or signal transmission systems. Reducing or offsetting response delays could assist in more positive outcomes for medical interventional devices and improved fuel use/efficiency along with reduced emissions in transportation. The prolific variant of beneficial applications also includes increased yields in manufacturing and production and more accurate real-time targeting in military defense. """

He sent the board a letter detailing moves they need to make to shift to a more online platform, but I guess whatever narrative works in your favor is true right? That was back in November. Now RC and 2 of his old Chewy execs are board members of GME.

And they already are doing things listed such as closing underperforming stores, leads to less negative cash flow and more profit. 

There’s plenty of DD about how GME is pivoting and becoming more gamer-centric including stocking of and selling pc parts, turning stores into PC building stations, etc.. but keep your head in the sand thinking there’s no future and that RC and the CFO and COO from Chewy are all on the board of directors now for no reason and that this is a sinking ship.

If your psychology cannot stand swing trades that take time to mature, either change your strategy (momentum trade, day trade, scalp trade) or diversify. Imagine if DeepFuckingValue felt the same way you're feeling right now. He could say he could be growing his millions of dollars worth of portfolio and it could be going parabolic right now (OR, could also be losing it. That's also survivorship bias: how do you assume you're going to win every single time you diversify or branch out? You can just as easily lose a significant amount of your capital as well.) The cool thing about what DeepFuckingValue was that he was patient, he stuck to his GME thesis, and his rewards are well deserved. At the end of the day it's up to you. It's your money, nobody online should make you feel hostage for it. If you're afraid of Monday's results, then de risk or de leverage. Its your money, and you're responsible for making sure you can stay in the game as long as possible to see these Melvin fuckers (and other shorts) burn. Or not. Up to you.

This was an older article from 2012 regarding it: [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/08/120810083611.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/08/120810083611.htm)

Where 'r' is your interest rate, 'n' is the number of times a year your interest is compounded, and lastly 't' goes for the number of years.

The estimate on the screenshot implied that you re-invest your returns after each trade into the following trades which in effect will be your compounding interest. Given the fact ofc that you still manage to perform those two 40% return trades (or four 20%, or twelve 10% ones).

In short, it's way more profitable to perform a load of lower return trades in a row which will (according to a formula provided above) serve as a number or times your interest gets compounded over the year. Hope it helps."

My investing time-frame for Salesforce is bullish for the year or two, then probably bearish in the VERY long term.

—if you’re talking about weekly options. Yeah, I agree. That’s gambling any way you cut it up."

If they made bank in March and exited their positions, that would mean that the consistent short interest isn’t from one player with very deep pockets but likely many players with less deep pockets. OR they didn’t get out of the position in March and they are dealing with an annoying fucking position and want to unwind as quickly as possible so they don’t have to deal with this shit.

ORRRRRR as you say....it’s so “insignificant” that they just flippantly close it all in an hour because LA TI DA we are high fucking class and don’t care about money. 

Either they made money and exited 6-9 months ago, they are still in it and are not having fun, or they are in it but don’t care about the losses since it’s a small position.

In all of those scenarios that’s good for longs."

So current price of GME is 21 we'll say. OK, cool, we expect it to go up this week so DEC 31st call, and you buy the next one up, the 22 call. Look at the price, oh, 1.02 for a call. Great, about $100 for the call. If it goes up to 22, I make money, right? Wrong wrong wrong. IV is incredibly high right now, because everyone expects huge moves either up or down. Since the stock can move huge, option sellers want to make sure they get paid, even if it does move, so that's priced in to the option. Take it to the optionsprofitcalculator. Here, I already did that for you, lazy ass: [http://opcalc.com/jQX](http://opcalc.com/jQX)

Look at the chart. At $22 stock price at expiry, you lost $2. Congrats!! Well fuck man, how can I avoid this expensive IV? There are a few ways, such as buying a close to the money call, and then selling a further out of the money call, which gives you some of that sweet IV premium to offset your costs. A cuck spread, because it cucks you into holding the short option leg until expiry.

But there is a secret way to avoid this IV thing all together. It's called buying shares. That's right. A share is like a call option, but only 1/100th of it, and with no time limit. It costs more to buy outright, but you can hold it forever. Crazy huh."

This was part of studies that showed on an aggregate level, actively managed funds only marginally outperformed passively managed funds, and most of those extra gains went to paying fund managers and the fees. That tiny extra profit came with great extra uncertainty as many funds close as they repeatedly fall short of market averages.

Stock picking shows the same story. Everyone talks about how you might pass up the next Amazon, but statistically the odds of you finding one of those before a whole crowd does is pretty low."

If they used their money and partnerships with major publishers and console makers to beef up a business model like ESE Entertainment and hooked that into a broader e-commerce strategy through partner marketing you could see them win back some of their brand with GenZ and take a big slice of the pie in a rapidly expanding competitive gaming and media landscape.

Especially if you’re as new as you say and have no idea what’s going on... Like the gentleman/woman before me said you should try shares just to see how the market works first. The profits are slower but the losses are too. You have to plan for the worse if you want to make money. Just an FYI when you have contracts with a close expiry even as far as a month out, you lose it faster than you gain it. It can take 10 minutes to go up $100 then within a minute you’re back in the red hundreds of dollars and it gets worse as you get closer to expiration. 

Before I go I want to leave you with some boomer advice; don’t put in what you can’t afford to lose and putting more money in your account doesn’t equate to making more money (unless you’re consistently profiting). Good luck and Godspeed my friend. I pray the gain gods favor you."

I'm saying this because believe it or not it's only been 5 months. In your lifetime and esp. in financial time that's a blink of an eye. Short fees are measured in years, not months, and financial cycles are, esp. in private industry, measured in decades, not years, so you might actually be dealing with short-interest that is older than you think from companies that know a lot more than you do with deals and bargains that you can't fathom. 

I do have to say this again: They do not pay what you do. They just don't. It's kind of like the Warren Buffet scenario where the financing and deals that they do you can't dream of. Imagine buying or shorting a stock at 10% what public would have to because you're saving the company or keeping the order flow afloat because there's no point to the outstanding. It's a different game.

That said buying the puts works; if you think about it, if the IIs have to sell that lowers the price because no one is buying it, it's just being returned, at net value. When short blocks close that definitely lowers the price and if your puts are there to catch you either break even or lose nothing. But they calculated all of this. 

It's hard to get your head around but they don't sweat like you do about these things."

Made some money but than pulled out before elections missing out on a nice run. Was hoping to get in but Pot stocks just kept running throughout November. Haven’t got back in and missed out on the merger news. I’m not a fan of Tilroy Jenkins (TLRY) but understand the momentum this will bring with the name in the US, unlike Apha. Problem is, what are tlry execs going to be paid once the merger is complete. Will prob get back in, but my portfolio is currently mostly in GME atm. 
I think that the price will come down to the mid 6s range, and if so will get back in. But TLRY has a lot of deadweight that needs to be trimmed otherwise the merger is bs. Simon has been talking about getting more US exposure and made a deal with that US brewery, which is nice but why merge with TLRY? APHA is on the right track to be a massive global pot enterprise."

6306,gh1exck,t3_kj226v,1,1608949239,Bkthrow1122,t1_gh17l8w,"No worries!

What you're missing is the distinction between buying the 30c (long aka a positive position) and selling the 35c (short aka a negative position). The 30c is going to start at a positive value (the premium you paid for it) and the 35c is going to start at a negative value (the premium you WERE paid for it). The sum of these two is how much you paid for the position.

If the stock price is at $20 at expiration, both calls expire worthless, and you're out whatever you paid. If it's over 30, the call you bought has value equal to the difference between the share price and $30, times 100. If it's under 35, the 35c you sold expires worthless, and it costs you nothing to settle the contract. If the share price is over $35, both the 30c you bought and the 35c you sold have value. But the 30c is worth exactly $500 more than the 35c, so settling both contracts would net you $500.


If the share price is 34.99 at expiration, your call is worth $499, and you don't have to deal with settling the 35c because it's worthless. But at say 35.15, your 30c is worth 515 and the 35c will cost you 15 to settle. At 35.50 it's $550 and costs you $50 to settle. Over 35 both go up at the exact same rate, hence why your profit is capped there at $500. At 34.99 you've basically made max profit and only have to deal with your positive contract.


Note these are all talking about the price at expiration. Before expiration, the price of the contract is going to gain or lose based on the movement of the underlying - if it climbs steeper than it would take to go over your contract at expiration, it will go up. If it's too flat to hit that target, the price will trend down. If you're already over your target, it will keep climbing toward that final value as long as it doesn't dive."

But the person selling is might be asking 54 and the person wanting to buy it and take the risk is willing to bid 34 for it. So robinhood averages the 2 and displays it on the screen.  I'm new to options,  and explaining it as best I understand it. But when you buying your going to pay close to the asking side, if you selling, then you will be paid closet to the bid side.

I have made my fair share of money this last year and have long calls for next year that I’m doing very well in. I originally posted this response because the people telling you to buy GME are shilling a Ponzi scheme in which they are making a lot more money than anyone buying within the last couple weeks. If you want to buy in that’s great for you and maybe you win some money but I would never advise you to do that. A lot of people ‘investing’ like this are really gambling and will likely lose everything later on in their trading career. You see a lot of posts on WSB, especially in the last year of people making crazy amounts of money but you will never see all of the people who have lost everything and will likely never trade again because of it. GME stock is probably fairly valued at around 15$. Not more and anyone telling you otherwise is either lying or part of the scheme. Good luck in your investing career but I would look to make money in other areas if you want to do this long term"

6758,gf4bq4j,t3_k9fhdf,1,1607476781,ADoIDo,t1_gf448gp,"Yes, 3-4 years ago they used to make money but the most 2 recent years, they have not. That's why the dividend stopped early in 2019. Now they're sitting at a 1b mkt cap and 1.2b in debt.

I can all but guarantee you that since they've taken on debt, they have no bought back shares. The first person who gets paid whenever money is realized, is the creditor. If GME had assets to put on the up for collateral, then they might be able to do the things you mentioned but all they have is used video games.

It's your money, you can fool yourself into thinking whatever you want."
